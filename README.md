This repository has for purpose to contain either modified or self-made UI related elements to have easy access to those when needed for a project.

It is something i started after realizing how inconvenient select htmlelements are in term of customization and thus deciding to emulate the behavior of a select through the use of other elements (button, ul, li) inside a parent div and then applying CSS for the style imitation (plus access to more customization) and JS for the behavior imitation.

To illustrate the structure needed for the JS classes to work, the DOM structure will be written in twig files.
